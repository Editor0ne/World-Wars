            <h1 class="w3-text-teal">World War II</h1>
            <p>World War II, also called the Second World War, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45. <br>
                The principal belligerents were the Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—and the Allies—France, Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and, to a lesser extent, China. <br> <br>
                The war was in many respects a continuation, after an uneasy 20-year hiatus, of the disputes left unsettled by World War I. <br>The 40,000,000–50,000,000 deaths incurred in World War II make it the bloodiest conflict, as well as the largest war, in history.
                Along with World War I, World War II was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. <br>
                It resulted in the extension of the Soviet Union's power to nations of Eastern Europe, enabled a communist movement to eventually achieve power in China, and marked the decisive shift of power in the world away from the states of Western Europe and toward the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>

            <h1 class="w3-text-teal">World War II: Germany invading Poland</h1>
            <p>The German conquest of Poland was the first demonstration of high-speed armoured warfare, and the Polish Army was outmoded and lacking in tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and antitank and antiaircraft guns. <br>
                <br>
                The Polish Army's forward concentration in the Polish Corridor and reserve in the north-central part of the country forfeited their chance of fighting a series of delaying actions, leading to the Germans' mechanized columns and Luftwaffe's terror bombing.
                The German invasion of Poland began on September 1, 1939, with the 3rd Army, 4th Army, and 10th Army attacking from Silesia and the Moravian and Slovakian border. <br>
                The Polish armies were splitting up into uncoordinated fragments, some retreating and others delivering disjointed attacks. <br>
                Poland was conquered for partition between Germany and the U.S.S.R., with the Germans taking 700,000 prisoners and 70,000 Polish soldiers killed.</p>
